# ASCII-Tetris

First attempt to create an ascii version of the videogame "Tetris"
code written in C++
trouble with the input so bloks don't move down unless 's' is pressed


#### I'm working on it

I'm rewriting the code from zero changing things like the input handler to make the blocks falling, the printing method with scanlines, the blocks' store method in both the game field and the memory itself
